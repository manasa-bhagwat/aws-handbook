# AWS Handbook
Handbook • Playbooks • Runbooks — A Complete AWS Knowledge System

This repository is a unified, structured AWS knowledgebase containing:

- **Handbook** (deep AWS architecture & internals)
- **Playbooks** (step-by-step procedures)
- **Runbooks** (incident response workflows)
- **Cheatsheets** (quick references)

It mirrors the documentation culture used in cloud-first engineering teams like AWS, Cloudflare, HashiCorp, Google SRE, and high-performance platform engineering orgs.

Use this repo as your authoritative reference for AWS learning, cloud operations, and long-term cloud mastery.

## Handbook (Deep AWS Learning)
Architecture, mental models, diagrams, patterns, internals.

Topics include:

- IAM concepts & permission boundaries  
- VPC networking & routing  
- S3 internals & storage behaviors  
- EC2 + Lambda compute models  
- DynamoDB partitioning strategies  
- Event-driven architectures  
- Observability: logs, metrics, traces  
- Terraform design patterns  

---

## Playbooks (Procedural Guides)
Repeatable “how-to” steps for:

- Creating IAM roles  
- Deploying Lambda functions  
- Setting up secure S3 buckets  
- Creating VPCs  
- Configuring CloudWatch alarms  
- Terraform workflows  

---

## Runbooks (Incident Response)
Troubleshooting workflows for:

- EC2 unreachable  
- S3 AccessDenied  
- DynamoDB throttling  
- Lambda timeout/root cause  
- VPC connectivity issues  
- Missing logs or metrics  

---

## Cheatsheets
Quick lookups for:

- IAM  
- VPC CIDR  
- DynamoDB  
- S3 commands  
- Terraform commands  
- CloudWatch  

---

## Purpose
This repo exists to:

- Centralize your AWS knowledge  
- Remove dependency on scattered tutorials  
- Build deep cloud intuition  
- Document platforms like a real cloud engineering team  
- Support your growth into Cloud Platform Engineer roles  

---

## Future Expansion
- Multi-account architecture references  
- Advanced Terraform modules  
- Cloud security frameworks  
- AWS interview prep section

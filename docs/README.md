A structured, practical handbook for learning and operating AWS services from a **beginner to early–intermediate** engineering perspective.

This repository focuses on **clear fundamentals**, **safe operational practices**, and **consistent documentation structure**, rather than exhaustive or expert-level coverage.

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Build a **solid AWS foundation** before advanced specialization
- Document AWS services in a way that mirrors **real engineering teams**
- Emphasize **clarity, correctness, and operational thinking**
- Avoid fragmented notes and ad-hoc learning

Advanced topics such as organization-wide governance, deep service internals, and large-scale optimization are intentionally out of scope.

---

## Intended Audience

This handbook is intended for:

- Engineers with **basic cloud computing knowledge**
- Learners with **minimal prior AWS exposure**
- Developers or infrastructure engineers transitioning into AWS

Readers are expected to understand:
- General cloud concepts (compute, storage, networking)
- Basic software or infrastructure terminology
- Command-line usage and configuration concepts

---

## Documentation Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Handbooks**  
  Conceptual explanations of AWS services and how they are designed to work.

- **Runbooks**  
  Deterministic, step-by-step guides for planned operational tasks.

- **Playbooks**  
  Troubleshooting and incident-response guides for common failure scenarios.

- **Policies**  
  Baseline governance rules and usage guidelines.

- **Cheatsheets**  
  Fast-reference material for day-to-day AWS usage.

Each section is designed to be readable independently while remaining consistent across the repository.

## Published Documentation

The handbook is published using **GitHub Pages** and the **Just the Docs** theme:

**Documentation Site:**  
https://manasa-bhagwat.github.io/aws-handbook/

The site provides structured navigation and is the recommended way to consume the content.

---

## Scope and Level

- **Depth:** Beginner → Early Intermediate  
- **Focus:** Foundations, correct usage, and safe defaults  
- **Not Covered:** Expert-level internals, advanced security models, or organization-scale architectures

The goal is to build confidence and correctness before moving to advanced topics.

---

## Design Principles

- Clear, neutral technical language
- No opinionated tooling advocacy
- No production-scale assumptions
- Emphasis on understanding over optimization
- Documentation-first approach

# AWS Engineering Handbook

This repository contains structured documentation for learning and operating AWS services from a **beginner to early–intermediate** perspective.

The content focuses on building **clear conceptual understanding**, **basic operational capability**, and **foundational governance awareness** for AWS-based infrastructure.

This is not an exhaustive or expert-level reference. Advanced AWS topics, organization-scale governance, and deep optimization techniques are intentionally out of scope.

---

## Intended Audience

This handbook is intended for:
- Engineers with **basic cloud computing knowledge**
- Learners with **minimal prior exposure to AWS**
- Developers or infrastructure engineers transitioning into AWS

Readers are expected to be familiar with:
- General cloud concepts (compute, storage, networking)
- Basic software or infrastructure terminology
- Command-line usage and configuration concepts

---

## Scope and Level

- **Depth:** Beginner → Early Intermediate  
- **Focus:** Understanding, correct usage, and safe defaults  
- **Not Covered:** Expert-level internals, advanced security models, or large-scale organizational patterns

The goal is to build a **solid AWS foundation** before progressing to advanced topics.

---

## Documentation Structure

The content is organized into the following sections:

- **Handbooks**  
  Conceptual explanations of AWS services and how they are designed to work.

- **Runbooks**  
  Step-by-step operational procedures for common, planned tasks.

- **Playbooks**  
  Troubleshooting and incident-response guides for common failure scenarios.

- **Policies**  
  Baseline governance rules and usage guidelines.

- **Cheatsheets**  
  Fast-reference material for day-to-day usage.

---

## How to Use This Handbook

- Start with **Handbooks** to understand core concepts
- Use **Runbooks** to perform routine operations
- Refer to **Playbooks** when diagnosing issues
- Apply **Policies** to maintain consistency
- Use **Cheatsheets** for quick recall

Each section is designed to be read independently while remaining consistent with the overall system.

---

## Design Principles

- Clear and neutral technical language
- No opinionated tooling recommendations
- No assumed production-scale experience
- Emphasis on correctness over optimization

---

This handbook is intended to evolve incrementally as knowledge depth increases, without compromising clarity at the foundational level.
